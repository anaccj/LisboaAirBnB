# Airbnb Lisbon Analysis

This project analyzes the Airbnb listings data for the city of Lisbon, Portugal, using SQL Server Management Studio and Tableau Public.

## Data Source

The data used for this analysis was obtained from the InsideAirbnb website, which provides publicly available AirBnB data for various cities around the world. The data includes information on Airbnb listings in Lisbon, such as their location, price, room type, availability, and host information.

## Data Cleaning and Analysis

The data was cleaned using Microsoft Excel and analyzed using SQL Server Management Studio. The cleaning process included altering the names of the neighbourhoods that were missing letters. The analysis included calculating the average price by room type and neighborhood, identifying the top hosts and most expensive listings, and projecting the yearly revenue for each listing.

## Visualization

The cleaned and analyzed data was then visualized using Tableau Public. The visualizations include maps showing the distribution of listings in Lisbon and the average price by neighborhood, as well as bar charts showing the distribution of listings by room type and neighborhood, the top hosts and most expensive listings, and the projected yearly revenue by host.

The final visualizations are shown in the [Airbnb Lisbon Market](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ana.catarina.jesus/viz/AirBnBLisbonMarket/Overview) dashboard.

## Conclusion

This project provides insights into the Airbnb listings in Lisbon and their distribution, pricing, and revenue potential. The results can be used by potential hosts to make informed decisions about their Airbnb listings and by travelers to make informed decisions about their accommodations in Lisbon.
